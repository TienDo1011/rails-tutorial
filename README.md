Twitter clone follow instructions in [rails-tutorial ver 4.0](https://rails-4-0.railstutorial.org/)

I re-write its front-end by using React instead of rails rendered app.

To start app:
1. Create a role named `postgres` with the ability to `CREATEDB`
2. Run `bin/boot_dev`
3. Navigate to `localhost:3000`
